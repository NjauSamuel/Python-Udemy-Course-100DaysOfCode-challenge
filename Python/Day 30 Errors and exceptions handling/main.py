# In programming since things might not go as we plan out for them to go, we could handle this by catching exceptions.

# This is so because we want our program to fall gracefully and not catastrophically.

# while dealling with errors the four things that matter are:

# try: something that might cause an exception.

# except: Do this if there was an exception.

# else: Do this if there were no exceptions.
