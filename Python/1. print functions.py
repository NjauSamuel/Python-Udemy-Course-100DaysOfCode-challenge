print("Day 1. Python printing function")


# A back slash new line could help us in the implementation of multiple lines of print statements into a single one

# And example
print("Hello World!\nHello World\nHello World!")


# String concatenation and Code intelligence, is possible through the '+' operator.
# For example
# For this part, the space could be added throught the help of another string at the middle i.e " "
print("Hello" + "Njau")

# Code intelligence referes to the way a ode editor is able to show you the errors that you get, e.g for vs code.


# Code debugging
# This referes to the removal of errors from a piece of code

# The Python Input Function
# It looks like this "input(prompt)"

# an example use looks like
input("What is your name?")

print("Hello" + input("What is your name?"))

name = input("What is your name?")
print(len(name))

# since t is called a variable, ot can vary


# Challenge Switch the values between two variables
